# CareerCompass
This application is designed for currently enrolled students and recent graduates, offering a platform akin to LinkedIn but focused on entry-level job seekers. Recruiters can post job openings and events, while users can connect, message, create posts, and engage with communities aligned with their interests or career goals.
